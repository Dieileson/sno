## Latest / Source Code

SNO does not currently have a release schedule or process. If you want the latest version, you'll need to build SNO yourself from source. Better documentation on the development process for SNO is a future goal.

To check out the source code for SNO, visit our [Github Page](http://www.github.com/osmose/sno). Pull requests gladly accepted!
